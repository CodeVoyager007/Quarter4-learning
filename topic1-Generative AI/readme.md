This folder contains my research notes on AI topics for the **Q4 learning task**.
The first topic is **"What is Generative AI?"**, for which we’ve been given **2 days** to research using any preferred resources (Google, YouTube, blogs, etc.).

## 🚀 Getting Started

I've already begun exploring this topic and have a bit of background from my earlier blog posts:

* 🔄 **[Agentic AI vs Traditional AI](https://mughalsyntax.hashnode.dev/agentic-ai-vs-traditional-ai)**
  This post explains the difference between traditional task-based AI and agentic AI, which involves more autonomy and decision-making.

* 🤖 **[Exploring Agentic AI: Building Intelligent Agents](https://mughalsyntax.hashnode.dev/exploring-agentic-ai-building-intelligent-agents)**
  Here, I dive into how intelligent agents work, how they can plan and act, and why agentic models matter in the future of AI.

These gave me a head start in understanding **generative** and **agentic** systems, and I’ll be building further on that through this repo.
