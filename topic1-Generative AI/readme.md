Q4_Learning
This folder contains my research notes on AI topics for the Q4 learning task. The first topic is "What is Generative AI?", for which we’ve been given 2 days to research using any resources we prefer (Google, YouTube, etc.).

I've already started exploring this topic and have some background through my earlier blogs:

Agentic AI vs Traditional AI — This post explains the difference between traditional task-based AI and agentic AI, which involves more autonomy and decision-making. visit here: https://mughalsyntax.hashnode.dev/agentic-ai-vs-traditional-ai

Exploring Agentic AI: Building Intelligent Agents — Here, I dive into how intelligent agents work, how they can plan and act, and why agentic models matter in the future of AI. visit here : https://mughalsyntax.hashnode.dev/exploring-agentic-ai-building-intelligent-agents

These gave me a head start in understanding generative and agentic systems, and I’ll be building further on that here.
Feel free to reach me out and suggest more to help me learn
